			<p><b>We are EarsOn Team</b></p><hr>
			<p>In India’s fast growing retail industry filled with crowded hyper markets, monotonous electronic chains and absent music outlets, comes an innovative concept store that combines fashion, technology and entertainment. Headphone Zone is India’s first exclusive online store for headphones, earphones and personal Audio devices featuring the world's finest headphones from brands renowned for their sound, design and style. 
Raghav Somani started Headphone Zone in 2010 after realising that most big retailers had little to no understanding of electronic accessories such as headphones or earphones and consumers had little understanding or options. And so, it is our commitment to personalize your listening experience as much as possible.</p>
